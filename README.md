# 2D Triangulation
This is a C++ program that implements a 2D triangulation algorithm. The program generates a set of points and uses them to create triangles that cover the entire 2D space.

## Features
- Generates a set of unique points randomly or in a lattice pattern.
- Performs a triangulation using the generated points.
- Implements a cleanup algorithm to remove unnecessary triangles.
- Calculates the distance between points and lines.
- Checks for intersection between line segments.

## Dependencies
- freeglut
- FreeImage

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Compile the program:
4. Run the program:
 
## Usage
The program provides a graphical interface using freeglut. After running the program, you can interact with the window as follows:

- Left-click: Generate points and perform triangulation.
- Right-click: Open the context menu.

In the context menu, you can choose to generate points randomly or in a lattice pattern. You can also quit the program.
